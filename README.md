================================



Simple web application that connects via telnet to a router and executes a fixed number of commands. It then displays the router's outputs separately so that the outputs can be easily copied to clipboard. This is an alpha release so do expect to find bugs.
If you are running the same commands in routers all day and are stuck using telnet I suggest you take a look.

Beta coming soon
--------------------
+ 1 Click copying 
+ Ping and traceroute from available up interfaces
+ Execute your own commands right from the web interface
